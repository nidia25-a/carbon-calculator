# carbon-calculator
Carbon calculator is a web development project designed to calculate and track greenhouse gas emissions from various sources such as home energy usage, car fuel usage, and renewable energy usage. Users manually enter their data into designated fields, and the system calculates the total emissions and renewable offsets based on backend logic.


Tools and Technologies
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: PostgreSQL
Features:
1. User Input Fields:
Home energy usage
Car fuel usage
Renewable energy usage
2. Emissions Calculation:
The backend logic processes the user input to calculate the total greenhouse gas emissions.
It uses specific formulas and coefficients to convert the input data into equivalent GHG emissions.
3. Renewable Offsets Calculation:
The system also calculates the renewable energy offsets, which are subtracted from the total emissions to give a net
emissions value.
This feature helps users understand the impact of their renewable energy usage on reducing their carbon footprint.
4. Data Storage and Retrieval:
User data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
The system can retrieve and display historical data for users to track their emissions over time.
5. User-Friendly Interface:
The frontend is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical
expertise.

Purpose and Benefits:
Environmental Awareness: By tracking their greenhouse gas emissions, users become more aware of their
environmental impact.
Sustainable Practices: The system encourages users to adopt more sustainable practices by highlighting the benefits
of renewable energy usage.
Data-Driven Decisions: Users can make informed decisions about their energy consumption and transportation
choices based on the data provided by the system.
This project combines web development skills with environmental consciousness, offering a valuable tool for individuals and
organizations looking to reduce their carbon footprin
